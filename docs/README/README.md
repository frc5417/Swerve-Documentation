First Robotics is a place where creativity, passion, and nerdiness all intercept. All of us at Team 5417 have first-hand experience of the wonderful community that First Robotics provides, and a key part of the memories we’ve made is our robot.

A team’s robot is typically what first comes to mind when mentioned. It’s more than just the competitor; It’s a physical symbol of the time, effort, and determination that each individual team member has put in; It’s a large part of what makes an FRC team an FRC team. It’s for this reason that we decided it was necessary to make a swerve bot, specifically our swerve bot, Vira.
