# Applications for Swerve

Swerve when paired with a proper arm and manipulator can be a great offensive robot, but can function on its own (just the drivetrain) as a defensive bot.

??? info "What does offensive and defensive mean?"

    Offensive means that the robot is primarily focused on scoring as many game elements as possible. Defensive robots, on the other hand, are focused on preventing the opposing alliance from scoring game elements.
