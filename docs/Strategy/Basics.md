# Strategy Basics 

Before delving into particular drive strategy, it is crucial to understand the pros and cons of swerve drive.

    === "Pros"

        ``` markdown
        * Far faster than other drivetrain options (we run at ~3.8 m/s)
        * Tighter manuverability and control
          - Smaller turn radius and strafing allows for less congestion in small spaces and faster cycle times.
        * In certain wheel and motor arangements, the robot can shrug off heavy hits without moving or taking substantial damage.
        * Manuverabity enhances the ability to dodge incoming, defensive robots with ease. 
        * Increased flexibility and options for autonomous mode.
        ```

    === "Cons"

        ``` markdown
        * Intesive power consumption and battery sagging.
        * Eight motors for drivetrain alone increase points of failure exponentially.
          - Increased wiring complexity
        * Less stable (higher center of gravity)
        * Difficult to control (driving aspect)
        * Expensive
          - Must always keep spare parts and modules in case of damage during competition.
          - Difficult to repair
